## 1. Introduction
- **Purpose:** This guide provides step-by-step instructions to implement and configure a resilient, scalable web application on AWS.  
- **Scope:** Covers AWS infrastructure setup, security, deployment, monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery.  
- **References:** AWS documentation and best practice guides.  

---

## 2. Prerequisites
- **AWS Account:** Active AWS account required.  
- **IAM Roles:** Required IAM roles with appropriate permissions.  
- **Knowledge Base:** Basic AWS, networking, and Linux administration knowledge.

### Description
High-level architecture with multiple Availability Zones for high availability, auto-scaling for traffic, and secure networking.

## 4. AWS Services Configuration

### 4.1 Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
**Step 1: Create the VPC**
1. Go to VPC Dashboard → "Create VPC"  
2. Name: `App-VPC`  
3. IPv4 CIDR: `192.168.0.0/24`  
4. Tenancy: Default  
5. Click "Create"  

**Step 2: Create Subnets**
- Public_Subnet_1A: AZ `ap-south-1a`, CIDR `192.168.0.0/26`  
- Private_Subnet_1A: AZ `ap-south-1a`, CIDR `192.168.0.128/26`  
- Public_Subnet_2B: AZ `ap-south-1b`, CIDR `192.168.0.64/26`  
- Private_Subnet_2B: AZ `ap-south-1b`, CIDR `192.168.0.192/26`  

**Step 3: Internet Gateway**
1. Create and name `IGW-App`  
2. Attach to VPC  

**Step 4: Route Tables**
- Create `Public-RT`, add route `0.0.0.0/0 → IGW-App`  
- Associate public subnets  

**Step 5: NAT Gateway for Private Subnets**
- Create NAT in public subnet, allocate Elastic IP  
- Create private route table → route traffic to NAT

### 4.2 Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
![EC2 Setup](images/ec2.png)

- Launch EC2 instances in private/public subnets.  
- Configure Auto Scaling groups with policies (CPU/request-based).  
- Use AMIs with required dependencies.  

---

### 4.3 Elastic File System (EFS)
![EFS Setup](images/efs.png)

- Create EFS and mount targets in all required subnets.  
- Configure security groups for EC2 access.  

---

### 4.4 Application Load Balancer (ALB)
![ALB Setup](images/alb.png)

- Create ALB in public subnets.  
- Configure listeners and target groups pointing to EC2 instances.  
- Enable health checks.  

---

### 4.5 Route 53
![Route 53 Setup](images/route53.png)

- Create hosted zone and add DNS records to ALB.  
- Configure health checks and routing policies.  

---

## 5. Application Deployment
![Application Deployment](images/deployment.png)

- Deploy code to EC2 (SSH, CodeDeploy, or CI/CD).  
- Use environment variables or config management for settings.  

---

## 6. Security Configuration
![Security Setup](images/security.png)

- **Security Groups:** Control inbound/outbound traffic.  
- **IAM Policies:** Assign least-privilege permissions.  
- **Encryption:** EFS encryption at rest, TLS for in-transit.  

---

## 7. Monitoring and Logging
![Monitoring](images/monitoring.png)

- **CloudWatch:** Setup metrics, alarms, dashboards.  
- **Logging:** Application/system logs → CloudWatch or S3.  

---

## 8. Backup and Disaster Recovery
![Backup & DR](images/backup.png)

- Regular EFS/database backups to S3.  
- Cross-AZ or cross-region replication if required.  
- Document recovery steps.  

---

## 9. Troubleshooting
![Troubleshooting](images/troubleshooting.png)

- Common issues: connectivity, scaling failures, deployment errors.  
- Use CloudWatch, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs to debug.  

---

## 10. Additional Resources
- AWS Docs: [https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/)  
- AWS best practices for security, scaling, and HA.  

---

## 11. Appendices
- **Appendix A:** Detailed configuration tables (CIDR, instance types, subnets).  
- **Appendix B:** Sample scripts for EC2 setup, EFS mount, ALB config.
